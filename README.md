Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of
  high-quality software systems.
Importance:
 It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming language e.g fortran and C
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting users' needs
2. Design: creating high level designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
4. Testing: conduct various tests to see whether the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment: release the software to users or customers
6. Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: It is a Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall, example in development of a 
payroll system where requirements are well defined
Agile: It is a method of development where requirements can change frequently, its focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change
like in development of an online shopping platform where continuous improvements and quick responses to user behavior are crucial. 
Agile supports frequent updates and feature releases.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS are software engineering tools they enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, 
version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines:  you can overcome this by early planning and effective communication and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
Change of requirements:  you can use agile methodologies to overcome this

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance: Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps in avoiding confusing or vague answers by helping craft clear and specific prompts for AI 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Describe the culture of Kenya

Improved Prompt:
Explore the vibrant culture of Kenya by detailing its diverse ethnic groups, traditional music and dance, and the role of festivals in community life. 
Highlight how modern influences are blending with traditional practices to shape contemporary Kenyan society.
-The Improved prompt is more effective because its specific, focused or clear and direct making it easier for the AI to respond
